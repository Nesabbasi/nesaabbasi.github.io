I am a research intern at the Natural Language Processing Lab at the University of Tehran under supervision <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TvGqaqAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Y. Yaghoobzadeh</a>. My main contribution to our paper, <em>"Benchmarking Large Language Models for Persian: A Preliminary Study Focusing on ChatGPT,"</em> focuses on the sentiment analysis task. In this study, we evaluate large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and OpenChat-3.5 on various Persian language tasks. Specifically, my role involves assessing how well these models can classify sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative) in Persian text. By comparing their performance to fine-tuned models, I aim to highlight the strengths and limitations of these LLMs in processing sentiments in a low-resource language like Persian, contributing to the broader evaluation of LLM efficiency in non-English contexts.
