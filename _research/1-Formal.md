I am a research intern at the **Formal Methods and Validation of Systems Lab** at the University of Tehran under supervision [Prof. F. Ghassemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymM5kfAAAAAJ&hl=en). My main task is focused on extending [Hybrid Rebeca](https://rebeca-lang.org/), a formal modeling language for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), to support non-deterministic time behaviors and facilitate efficient reachability analysis. Hybrid Rebeca, based on the actor model, provides a powerful way to model CPSs by integrating discrete event-driven software components with continuous physical dynamics. My work involves developing the [Afra](https://rebeca-lang.org/alltools/Afra) tool to automatically generate the state space of Hybrid Rebeca models, enabling formal verification of CPSs, such as automotive brake systems. By extending the language and optimizing the analysis techniques, I aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of verifying safety-critical systems at the design stage.
