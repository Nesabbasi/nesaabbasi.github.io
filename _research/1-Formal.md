I am a research intern at the Formal Methods and Validation of Systems Lab at the University of Tehran under supervision <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymM5kfAAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. F. Ghassemi</a>. My main task is focused on extending <a href="https://rebeca-lang.org/">Hybrid Rebeca</a>, a formal modeling language for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), to support non-deterministic time behaviors and facilitate efficient reachability analysis. Hybrid Rebeca, based on the actor model, provides a powerful way to model CPSs by integrating discrete event-driven software components with continuous physical dynamics. My work involves developing the <a href="https://rebeca-lang.org/alltools/Afra">Afra</a> tool to automatically generate the state space of Hybrid Rebeca models, enabling formal verification of CPSs, such as automotive brake systems. By extending the language and optimizing the analysis techniques, I aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of verifying safety-critical systems at the design stage.
