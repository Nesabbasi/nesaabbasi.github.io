I am a research intern at the Formal Methods and Validation of Systems Lab at the University of Tehran under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymM5kfAAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. F. Ghassemi</a>. My work focuses on the verification of asynchronous, event-based Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) using model checking techniques. Specifically, I have extended <a href="https://rebeca-lang.org/">Hybrid Rebeca</a>, an actor-based formal modeling language, to support non-deterministic time behaviors, enhancing its applicability in the modeling of CPSs that integrate both discrete event-driven components and continuous physical dynamics. Through these extensions and optimizations, my goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of verifying CPSs at the design stage.
